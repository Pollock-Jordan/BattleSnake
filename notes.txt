1. Evaluate Dijkstra's for our current head position.
2. For each safe move, create a simulated board state,
   where in addition to our move, all of our opponents
   have one move simulated (towards their closest food
   that doesn't conflict with anyone else's move, taking
   into account (1) if they ate food or (2) if they died).
3. For each simulated board state, run Dijkstra's and flood fill.
4. With the information provided by Dijkstra's and flood fill,
   assign a score to each simulated board state. Make the move
   that corresponds to the simulated board state with the best
   score.

Number of Dijkstra's runs = number of safe moves * number of opponents
Number of flood fills = number of safe moves
